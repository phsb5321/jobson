Working in your own office, surrounded by thousands of high-caliber developers, you\u2019ll use modern development methodologies and employ user-centered design, analytics, and machine learning tools to drive innovation in healthcare. Using leading-edge technologies and languages like JS, TS, and C#, you\u2019ll invent better ways to reduce medical errors, streamline record sharing between hospitals, and provide the quality of care a patient deserves.\n\nWrite software for the most innovative health systems on the planet.\n\nThe top-ranked health systems in U.S. News and World Report are Epic customers. Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.\n\nExperience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.\n\nWe don\u2019t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but\u2026) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King\u2019s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they\u2019re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you\u2019ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyonc\u00e9 concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.\n\nLive affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.\n\nEpic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin, which is the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States, home to the state capital, and the University of Wisconsin. Madison has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison\u2019s first arcade bar.\n\nMore than just important work.\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Epic is an Equal Opportunity employer. We seek diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences in our mission to improve healthcare.
